"ST.INT.RCPT.CD","International tourism, receipts (current US$)","International tourism receipts are expenditures by international inbound visitors, including payments to national carriers for international transport. These receipts include any other prepayment made for goods or services received in the destination country. They also may include receipts from same-day visitors, except when these are important enough to justify separate classification. For some countries they do not include receipts for passenger transport items. Data are in current U.S. dollars.","World Tourism Organization, Yearbook of Tourism Statistics, Compendium of Tourism Statistics and data files.",
