"ST.INT.XPND.CD","International tourism, expenditures (current US$)","International tourism expenditures are expenditures of international outbound visitors in other countries, including payments to foreign carriers for international transport. These expenditures may include those by residents traveling abroad as same-day visitors, except in cases where these are important enough to justify separate classification. For some countries they do not include expenditures for passenger transport items. Data are in current U.S. dollars.","World Tourism Organization, Yearbook of Tourism Statistics, Compendium of Tourism Statistics and data files.",
