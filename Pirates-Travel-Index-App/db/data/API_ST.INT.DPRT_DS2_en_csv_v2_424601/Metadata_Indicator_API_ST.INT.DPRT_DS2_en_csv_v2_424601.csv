"ST.INT.DPRT","International tourism, number of departures","International outbound tourists are the number of departures that people make from their country of usual residence to any other country for any purpose other than a remunerated activity in the country visited. The data on outbound tourists refer to the number of departures, not to the number of people traveling. Thus a person who makes several trips from a country during a given period is counted each time as a new departure.","World Tourism Organization, Yearbook of Tourism Statistics, Compendium of Tourism Statistics and data files.",
